# Root Calculator using the Bisection Method
A simple program to approximate a zero from a given function using a linear approximation method.

## Description
This program will read user typed function and will attempt to find a zero using a linear approximation method. The method will recursively use the following equation until the value becomes close to zero:
### x_{n+1} = x_n - (f(x_n) / f'(x_n+1))
However to simplify, I will be using
